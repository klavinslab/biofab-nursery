# aquarium-deployment
consolidated repository for deployment scripts

This directory contains a clone of the aquarium-deployment repo slightly
modified to serve an aquarium instance on EC2.
Most of the settings are in the .env file.

The `run-production.sh` script will run aquarium using docker-compose in a way
analogous to the configuration in the aquarium-local repository.
